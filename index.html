    <p> <strong>
       <h3><u>Greetings!!!</u></h3>
Generally, Hangman is a quick and easy 
game for at least two people that requires nothing
 more than paper, a pencil, and the ability to spell.
  One player, the "host," makes up a secret word, 
  while the other player tries to guess the word by
   asking what letters it contains. However, every 
   wrong guess brings them one step closer to losing. <br>
But here the game will be played between you and the computer. <br>
Read below how to play âž˜
